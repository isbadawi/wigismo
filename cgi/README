This is a python CGI implementation of 08rps.wig, a rock-paper-scissors wig
service we found in public_html/wig/examples/lkwig. We looked to wig4 and the 
example from the slides for inspiration, but tried to make use of nicer 
features of python whenever possible.

* Python has an extensive standard library, making certain tasks easier; for 
  instance, the cgi module takes care of parsing the query string, and we use 
  pickle to save/load state to/from a file. Note that our implementation of 
  Store is not synchronized right now, so global variables are not safe for 
  concurrent threads.
* We follow wig4's approach for a few parts:
    - Sessions are identified by a 20-byte random string in the URL
    - Globals are stored in a file, but only when they are actually assigned
      to; we provide a default value (corresponding to the type: 0 for ints, 
      '' for strings, False for bools).
    - Locals are stored in a file. However, pickle makes this a bit more
      convenient; we just keep one dictionary of local variables per session, 
      and pickle the whole thing when we need to save state and exit. Then we
      can load the whole thing again, and things like casting to correct types
      are not an issue.
    - HTML constants correspond to functions printing HTML.
* Rather than using gotos, each Session becomes a series of functions, where
  each function represents an entry point from the CGI script's point of view 
  -- in our case, the start of a while loop, the statement after a while loop 
  and following each show statement. We may also need them for if statements. 
  This can be a bit complicated and we're still not sure we've got it exactly 
  right, but for example:

session Hello() {
    i = 45;
    while (1 == 1) {
        show Test;
        i = 46;
    }
    exit Test;
}

would correspond (in pseudocode) to four functions, namely:

Hello_1() {
    i = 45;
    if (1 == 1)
        Hello_While_1();
    Hello_2();
}

Hello_While_1() {
    // print Test
    // save state
    // write 'Hello_While_2' to file
}

Hello_While_2() {
    i = 46;
    if (1 == 1)
        Hello_While_1();
    Hello_2();
}

Hello_2() {
    // print Test
    // exit
}

When the session starts, Hello_1() is called, which then calls Hello_While_1()
-- Hello_While_1() exits, writing 'Hello_While_2' to file. When the script
starts again for the same session, it reads 'Hello_While_2' and calls the 
corresponding function (using reflection, but this is not strictly necessary),
which executes the rest of the loop and decides whether to go back to the start.
