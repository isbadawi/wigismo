wigismo

The main restriction wigismo has is that it doesn't handle show and exit
statements in functions (these are weeded out).

From the 2009 benchmarks, wigismo accepts and compiles everything except
wigg.wig (because of a self closing input tag) and battle.wig (because of
an input tag with content, i.e. <input>something</input>).

Compile a service example.wig with

wigismo example.wig
this generates an example.py file (use the -o switch to change this). 
Copy this to the directory you'd like to serve from, chmod it to 755, and
also put the wigismo.py module in the same directory.
